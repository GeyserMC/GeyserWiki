_A bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition._

**Currently, supporting Minecraft Bedrock {{ site.data.versions.bedrock }} and Minecraft Java {{ site.data.versions.java }}**

The goal of Geyser is to bridge the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition by allowing Bedrock clients to join Java Edition servers. This project is still in development and not complete yet, so expect bugs.
