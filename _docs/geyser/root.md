_A bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition._

**Currently, supporting Minecraft Bedrock 1.17.41 - 1.18.12 and Minecraft Java 1.18/1.18.1**

The goal of Geyser is to bridge the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition by allowing Bedrock clients to join Java Edition servers. This project is still in development and not complete yet, so expect bugs.
