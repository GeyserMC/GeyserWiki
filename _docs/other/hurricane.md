## Hurricane

Hurricane is a Paper/Spigot plugin, and Fabric mod (unofficial port), that fixes some bugs that otherwise cannot be fixed without server modification. 

### Fixes
Issues with each workaround are listed in the plugin's config. **Please take your time to read them as the workarounds in this plugin can be used for exploitative purposes.**

- Bamboo and dripstone collision (by setting them to no server-side collision)
- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/638 by implementing the control server-side.

Supported Versions:
- 1.14.x - 1.19.x
