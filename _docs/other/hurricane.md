Hurricane is a Paper/Spigot plugin, and Fabric mod (unofficial port), that fixes some bugs that otherwise cannot be fixed without server modification. 

### Fixes

- Bamboo and dripstone collision (by setting them to no server-side collision)
- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/638 by implementing the control server-side.

Supported Versions:
