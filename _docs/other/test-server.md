title: Test Server
---

### Details
- IP: `test.geysermc.org` (default ports on both Bedrock and Java)
- World size: 20k x 20k

### Infomation
Geyser has a test server for those who want to test how Java <-> Bedrock crossplay works on their device, and to see the limitations and restrictions. You can join from either Bedrock or Java, and the server has [Floodgate](/floodgate/) installed so you donâ€™t need a Java account to join from Bedrock.

If you can't build/destroy/interact with the world in the test server, run `/rtp` to get away from the protected spawn area.

If you have any questions or problems be sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/geysermc)!
