# Floodgate Setup

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
	Floodgate does <b>NOT</b> replace Geyser! It allows Geyser players to join servers without needing to log into a paid Java Edition account. <br/>
</div>

<TabItem value="spigot" label="Paper / Spigot">

## Floodgate-Spigot setup

1. Download Floodgate-Spigot from the [download page](https://download.geysermc.org/v2/projects/floodgate/versions/latest/builds/latest/downloads/spigot).
2. Place the Floodgate-Spigot.jar in the `plugins` folder, and restart the server.
3. Change `auth-type` in Geyser's config to `floodgate`.

## Floodgate-Fabric setup

1. Download Floodgate-Fabric from the [modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/floodgate).
2. Place the Floodgate-Fabric.jar in the `mods` folder, and restart the server. **You also need [FabricAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) installed.**
3. Change `auth-type` in Geyser's config to `floodgate`.
4. Restart the server.


**Note for Fabric behind a Velocity proxy:**
You will need to configure FabricProxyLite to allow the Fabric server to receive data from Velocity.

## Floodgate setup on a BungeeCord/Velocity proxy

:::info
You only need to install Floodgate on the BungeeCord or Velocity proxy server, unless you want to use the Floodgate API on the backend servers.
Additionally, it will display Bedrock edition skins properly.
:::

1. Download Floodgate for your proxy software from the [download page](https://geysermc.org/download).
2. Place the Floodgate jar in the `plugins` folder, and restart the proxy server.
3. Change `auth-type` in Geyser's config to `floodgate`.
4. Restart the server.

## Installing Floodgate on servers behind the proxy

This is only needed when you want to use the Floodgate API on your backend server(s) behind a proxy.

1. After installing Floodgate on the proxy, install Floodgate on the backend servers (either Floodgate-Spigot, or Floodgate-Fabric).
2. Enable `ip_forward` in your BungeeCord `config.yml` if using BungeeCord. For Velocity, set up [player information forwarding](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding).
3. Set bungeecord to true in your spigot.yml. When using Velocity, see their guide, as they have multiple options that require different setups.
4. Start the proxy server.
5. Edit the Floodgate config on your proxy server and set send-floodgate-data to true.
6. Copy the `key.pem` file in the proxy Floodgate config folder to all backend serversâ€™ Floodgate config folder.
7. Restart the backend servers and proxy server.

This key is what allows for Bedrock accounts to bypass the Java Edition authentication, and if anyone gets ahold of this, they can wreak havoc on your server.

2. Install the Floodgate jar - see the platform instructions for detailed info.
3. Change `auth-type` in Geyser Standalone's config to `floodgate`.
