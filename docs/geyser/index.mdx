_A bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition._

[//]: # (TODO: MEOW)

**Currently, supporting Minecraft Bedrock <Versions platform="bedrock"/> and Minecraft Java <Versions platform="java"/>**

The goal of Geyser is to bridge the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition by allowing Bedrock clients to join Java Edition servers. This project is still in development and not complete yet, so expect bugs.
